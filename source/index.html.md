# Introduction

Sponsus is a new Social Sponsorship platform being developed from the ground up with the needs of the creator and supporter in mind! As a creator, you can share your content, and receive sponsorship from people interested in supporting your work, and provide rewards in a tier system based on how much a sponsor wishes to to give! As a user, you can sponsor your favorite creators and help them achieve their dreams through an easy to use interface that charges automatically without needing micromanagement. Manage your sponsorships through an very easy to use panel, and receive recognition for your awesomeness from the creators through a robust and customizable plethora of tools we provide to the creators! 

<aside class="notice">
    The Sponsus API is still being built. The API is in a stable state but may return 500 errors for newer routes. This is so that we can work out all of the bugs and make sure it returns the right value. If you get some of these errors, please contact support and we can help fix it for you!

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: api_key"
```

> Make sure to replace `api_key` with your API key.

Sponsus uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can create a new API key [here](https://sponsus.org/developers/keys)

For all requests that feature `@me` or are personal to the account holder, Sponsus expects the Authorization header to be set like this:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
